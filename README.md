# Semblance - The barest trace

Semblance aims to be a quickly installable and usable framework for
creating a Prolog web application.

You can think of it as the prologue to your Prolog web application.

# Contact

Reach out to me at [the GitHub
page](https://github.com/ahungry/semblance) for more help.

# Soon

Plan to see a tutorial at http://ahungry.com/blog/ that will go over
the full process, as well as a much more robust initial setup process
to begin with, including a run once wizard to layout the file
structure etc.

# Thanks

Thanks to Anniepoo for her work on
[weblog](https://github.com/Anniepoo/weblog) which aims to be a
collection of useful HTML widgets and add-ons, as well as her Prolog
web tutorial, which inspired this project.
