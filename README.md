Reach out to me at [the GitHub
page](https://github.com/ahungry/semblance) for more help.

# Soon

Plan to see a tutorial at http://ahungry.com/blog/ that will go over
the full process, as well as a much more robust initial setup process
to begin with, including a run once wizard to layout the file
structure etc.
